            Salesforce started as Software as a Service (SaaS) CRM company. Salesforce now provides various 
            software solutions and a platform for users and developers to develop and distribute custom software. 
            Salesforce.com is based on multi-tenant architecture. This means that multiple customers share common 
            technology and all run on the latest release. You don’t have to worry about the application or 
            infrastructure upgrades – they happen automatically. This helps your organization focus on innovation 
            rather than managing technology.

            contexts. Sales Cloud helps track customer information and interactions in one place, automates complex

            Cloud9 is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that lets you write, run, 
            and debug your code with just a browser. It includes a code editor, debugger, and terminal. Cloud9 
            comes pre-packaged with essential tools for popular programming languages including JavaScript, 
            Python, PHP, and more, so you don’t need to install files or configure your development machine to 
            start new projects. Since your Cloud9 IDE is cloud-based, you can work on your projects from your 
            office, home, or anywhere using an internet-connected machine. Cloud9 also provides a seamless 
            experience for developing serverless applications allowing you to easily define resources, debug, 
            and switch between local and remote execution of serverless applications. With Cloud9, you can 
            quickly share your development environment with your team, allowing you to pair program and track

            AWS launched in 2006 from the internal infrastructure that Amazon.com built to handle its online 
            retail operations. AWS was one of the first companies to introduce a pay-as-you-go cloud computing 
            model that scales to provide users with compute, storage or throughput as needed.

            Amazon Web Services provides services from dozens of data centers spread across availability 
            zones (AZs) in regions across the world. An AZ represents a location that typically contains multiple 
            physical data centers, while a region is a collection of AZs in geographic proximity connected by 
            low-latency network links. An AWS customer can spin up virtual machines (VMs) and replicate data in 
            different AZs to achieve a highly reliable infrastructure that is resistant to failures of individual 
            servers or an entire data center.
