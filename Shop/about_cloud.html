                <h1><strong>What is "The Cloud"?</strong></h1>
                <p>Unlike those big fluffy things in the sky, "The Cloud" in the computing world is a network of servers. When tech companies say your data is in the cloud,
                or that you can work in the cloud, your data isnâ€™t actually in heaven or in the wind. It has a terrestrial home. Some servers provide an online service, 
                like Adobe Creative Cloud, and others allow you to store and access data, like Instagram or Dropbox.</p>

            <h1 class="cloud_reasons"><strong>So why would you use the cloud? Lets take a look.</strong></h1>
            
            <h3 class ="saas_heading">Software as a Service</h3>
            <p class="saas_body">Software as a service (SaaS) is a software distribution model in which a third-party provider hosts applications and makes them available to 
            customers over the Internet. SaaS is one of the main categories of cloud computing. SaaS removes the need for organizations to install and run applications on their 
            own computers or in their own data centers. This eliminates the expense of hardware acquisition, provisioning and maintenance, as well as software licensing, 
            installation and support. 
            <br>
            <br>
            A great example of a company using an SaaS model is SalesForce.
            <br>
            <br>
            This model has many great advantages including flexible payments, scalable use and automatic software updates.
            </p>
       
            <h3 class ="paas_heading">Platform as a Service</h3>
            <p class="paas_body">Platform as a service (PaaS) is a cloud computing model in which a third-party provider delivers hardware and software tools, usually those 
            needed for application development, to users over the internet. A PaaS provider hosts the hardware and software on its own infrastructure. As a result, PaaS 
            frees users from having to install in-house hardware and software to develop or run a new application. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Cloud9 is an example of a business operating a Paas.
            <br>
            <br>
            The principal benefit of PaaS is simplicity and convenience for users -- the PaaS provider supplies much of the infrastructure and other IT services, which 
            users can access anywhere via a web browser. PaaS providers then charge for that access on a per-use basis -- a model that many enterprises prefer, as it 
            eliminates the capital expenses they traditionally have for on-premises hardware and software. 
            </p>
        
            <h3 class ="iaas_heading">Infrastructre as a Service</h3>
            <p class="iaas_body">Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is a form of cloud computing that provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. In an 
            IaaS model, a cloud provider hosts the infrastructure components traditionally present in an on-premises data center, including servers, storage and networking 
            hardware, as well as the virtualization or hypervisor layer. The IaaS provider also supplies a range of services to accompany those infrastructure components. 
            These can include detailed billing, monitoring, log access, security, load balancing and clustering, as well as storage resiliency, such as backup, replication 
            and recovery.
            <br>
            <br>
            Amazon is a primary example of a company offering IaaS.
            <br>
            <br>
            Organizations choose IaaS because it is often easier, faster and more cost-efficient to operate a workload without having to buy, manage and support the 
            underlying infrastructure. With IaaS, a business can simply rent or lease that infrastructure from another business.
            </p>
            
            <h3 class ="caas_heading">Communication as a Service</h3>
            <p class="caas_body">Communications as a Service (CaaS) is an outsourced enterprise communications solution that can be leased from a single vendor. Such 
            communications can include voice over IP (VoIP or Internet telephony), instant messaging (IM), collaboration and videoconference applications using fixed and 
            mobile devices. CaaS has evolved along the same lines as Software as a Service (SaaS). The CaaS vendor is responsible for all hardware and software management 
            and offers guaranteed Quality of Service (QoS). CaaS allows businesses to selectively deploy communications devices and modes on a pay-as-you-go, as-needed 
            basis. This approach eliminates the large capital investment and ongoing overhead for a system whose capacity may often exceed or fall short of current demand.
            <br>
            <br>
            An example od CaaS is Google's Gmail .
            <br>
            <br>
            CaaS offers flexibility and expandability that small and medium-sized business might not otherwise afford, allowing for the addition of devices, modes or coverage 
            on demand. The network capacity and feature set can be changed from day to day if necessary so that functionality keeps pace with demand and resources are not 
            wasted. There is no risk of the system becoming obsolete and requiring periodic major upgrades or replacement.
