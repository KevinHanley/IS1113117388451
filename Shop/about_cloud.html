                <h1><strong>What is "The Cloud"?</strong></h1>
                <p>Unlike those big fluffy things in the sky, "The Cloud" in the computing world is a network of servers. When tech companies say your data is in the cloud,
                or that you can work in the cloud, your data isn’t actually in heaven or in the wind. It has a terrestrial home. Some servers provide an online service, 
                like Adobe Creative Cloud, and others allow you to store and access data, like Instagram or Dropbox.</p>

        <section>
            <h1 class="cloud_reasons"><strong>So why would you use the cloud?</strong></h1>
            
            <h3 class ="cloud_heading">Flexibility</h3>
            <p class="cloud_body">Cloud-based services are ideal for businesses with growing or fluctuating bandwidth demands. If your needs increase it’s easy to scale 
            up your cloud capacity, drawing on the service’s remote servers. Likewise, if you need to scale down again, the flexibility is baked into the service. This 
            level of agility can give businesses using cloud computing a real advantage over competitors.</p>
       
            <h3 class ="cloud_heading2">Work from Anywhere</h3>
            <p class="cloud_body2">With cloud computing, if you’ve got an internet connection you can be at work. And with most serious cloud services offering mobile apps,
            you’re not restricted by which device you’ve got to hand. The result? Businesses can offer more flexible working perks to employees so they can enjoy the 
            work-life balance that suits them – without productivity taking a hit. One study reported that 42% of workers would swap a portion of their pay for the 
            ability to telecommute. On average they’d be willing to take a 6% pay cut.</p>
        
            <h3 class ="cloud_heading3">Security</h3>
            <p class="cloud_body3">The loss of an expensive piece of kit (laptops, phones, etc.) can have disastrous consequences, such as a data security breach.
            Cloud computing gives you greater security when this happens. Because your data is stored in the cloud, you can access it no matter what happens to your 
            machine. And you can even remotely wipe data from lost laptops and phones so it doesn’t get into the wrong hands.</p>
            
            <h3 class ="cloud_heading4">Automatic Software Updates</h3>
            <p class="cloud_body4">The beauty of cloud computing is that the servers are off-premise, out of sight and out of your hair. Suppliers take care of them for 
            you and roll out regular software updates – including security updates – so you don’t have to worry about wasting time maintaining the system yourself. Leaving 
            you free to focus on the things that matter, like growing your business.</p>
