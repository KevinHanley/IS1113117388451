    	        <h1 class="cloud_intro">My interests in Cloud Services</h1>
    	            
    	        <p class="p_intro">There are many reasons why I find Cloud Computing Services interesting. In my opinion, cloud services are the future of computer storage, 
                both for personal and business use. The following is a list of the key reasons I support the move towards Cloud computing Services.</p>
    	    </div>
            
            <!-- Section 2 -->
    	    <div class="section" id="section2">
    	        <h1 class="section_heading1">Flexibility</h1>
    	        
    	        <p class="p_left">Cloud-based services are ideal for businesses with growing or fluctuating bandwidth demands. If your needs increase it’s easy to scale 
                up your cloud capacity, drawing on the service’s remote servers. Likewise, if you need to scale down again, the flexibility is baked into the service. This 
                level of agility can give businesses using cloud computing a real advantage over competitors.</p>
                
                <h1 class="section_heading2">Security</h1>
    	            
    	        <p class="p_right">The loss of an expensive piece of kit (laptops, phones, etc.) can have disastrous consequences, such as a data security breach.
                Cloud computing gives you greater security when this happens. Because your data is stored in the cloud, you can access it no matter what happens to your 
                machine. And you can even remotely wipe data from lost laptops and phones so it doesn’t get into the wrong hands.</p>
    	    </div>
 
            <!-- Section 3 -->
    	    <div class="section" id="section3">
    	        <h1 class="section_heading3">Work from anywhere</h1>
    	            
    	        <p class="p_left">With cloud computing, if you’ve got an internet connection you can be at work. And with most serious cloud services offering mobile apps,
                you’re not restricted by which device you’ve got to hand. The result? Businesses can offer more flexible working perks to employees so they can enjoy the 
                work-life balance that suits them – without productivity taking a hit. One study reported that 42% of workers would swap a portion of their pay for the 
                ability to telecommute. On average they’d be willing to take a 6% pay cut.</p>
                
                <h1 class="section_heading4">Automatic Software Updates</h1>
    	        
    	        <p class="p_right">The beauty of cloud computing is that the servers are off-premise, out of sight and out of your hair. Suppliers take care of them for 
                you and roll out regular software updates – including security updates – so you don’t have to worry about wasting time maintaining the system yourself. Leaving 
                you free to focus on the things that matter, like growing your business.</p>
