                <p>An energetic, fast-paced and immensely skillful game. This, amoung other reasons, 
                is why I love rugby. I have been a follower of rugby for many years. My dad and grandad kindled my interest 
                when I was young, as they were passionate supporters of Munster Rugby.</p>
                
                <p>Rugby is a hugh sport in the British Isles. Annually there are a number of high profile competitons 
                from the Guinness Pro 14, to Champions Cup, to the prestigious Six Nations Championship. The most notable 
                events in World Rugby though are the British and Irish Lions Tour and the World Cup which occur every 
                four years.</p>
                
                <p>Currently Ireland are ranked 3rd in the World Rankings behind New Zealand and England, respectively.</p>

            <div class="af_body">
                <p>I have become quite an American Football fan over recents years. I first began watching NFL between 2012 
                and 2013. I remember the first game I saw was the Green Bays Packers against the Detroit Lions, and as the 
                Packers were the underdogs I was following them for the win. Since then I'd tune in each weekend to watch 
                the Packers in their NFL clashes. They won the coveted superbowl back in 2011 and have since come agonisingly 
                close to reclaiming the title but have fallen short on each occasion.</p>

            <div class="golf_body">
                <p>Similarly to rugby, my dad and grandad are the cause of my interest in golf. I won't say that I follow it 
                each week or even each month but I love to watch the big tournaments that are held annually such as the FedEx Cup 
                and the Masters, which is the highlight of the golf year in my opinion.</p>
